# Personal Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-scale projects I’ve built during my learning and exploration of software development. Each project serves a specific purpose — either as a way to practice a technology, experiment with an idea, or solve a simple problem.

Most of these projects are not production-grade, but they reflect my development progress, understanding of various technologies, and ability to build functional prototypes.

## Structure

Each subfolder in this repository represents a separate project. Some projects may include a `README.md` file with additional information.

## Purpose

These projects are part of my learning journey. They help me:
- Practice using different tools and frameworks
- Understand common design patterns and workflows
- Build confidence in developing and deploying applications

## Notes

- Code quality and structure may vary across projects as many were developed at different stages of learning.
- Some projects may be missing tests, error handling, or deployment scripts — these are areas I continue to work on.
